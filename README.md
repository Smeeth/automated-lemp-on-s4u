# automated-lemp-on-s4u
My first try to get an automated installation for a LEMP-Stack on a dedicated server provided by server4you.de

This script will install fully automated the following packages preconfigured on your fresh Ubuntu 14.04 LTS installation on your dedicated server:

1. nginx
1. mysql
1. php5

## How to apply
Just copy, paste and execute the following

	cd /tmp
	wget https://github.com/Smeeth/automated-lemp-on-s4u/raw/master/install.sh
	./install.sh
